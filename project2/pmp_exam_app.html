What’s on the PMP exam?
Here’s an overview of what’s on the PMP certification test as of October 2024.
• 180 questions total
• 230 minutes (3 hours 50 minutes) to complete
• Two 10-minute breaks
• A combination of multiple-choice, multiple responses, matching, hotspot, and limited fill-in-the-blank questions
The questions fall into three domains:
People: 42 percent of exam
Composing a little less than half of the exam, the people section includes questions on leading and building teams, managing conflict, supporting virtual teams, mentoring, and other related topics.
Process: 50 percent of exam
The process section tests your knowledge on the methodology of seeing a project through to completion. You might be asked about managing budgets and other resources, scheduling, handling changes in the project, and determining the best methodologies for the project.
Business environment: 8 percent of exam
The business environment portion of the exam deals broadly with the more business-minded aspects you’ll have to tackle as a project manager, like compliance, delivering value, and supporting organizational change.
Roughly half of the content represents predictive project management approaches, while the other half represents Agile or hybrid approaches.
